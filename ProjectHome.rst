Introduction
============

PyroScope is a collection of tools for the BitTorrent protocol and
especially the rTorrent client. It offers the following components: \*
CommandLineTools for automation of common tasks, like metafile creation,
and `filtering and mass-changing your loaded
torrents <RtControlExamples.md>`_ \* patches to `improve your rTorrent
experience <RtorrentExtended.md>`_, like new commands and canvas
coloring \* rTorrent extensions like a QueueManager and statistics
(*work in progress*) \* a modern and versatile rTorrent web interface
(currently on hold)

See the ScreenShotGallery if you want to get a first impression without
installing the software.

can't do. To get in contact and share your experiences with other users
