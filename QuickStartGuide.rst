Installing the extended rTorrent-PS distribution
================================================

``rTorrent-PS`` is an alternative rTorrent executable with some changes
to the user interface (colors, one line per torrent display) and other
additions, plus stability patches applied. While there is some small
interaction with the PyroScope command line tools (especially
``rtcontrol``), both things are *independant*.

    ➽ *For details on the extended **``rTorrent-PS``** distribution
    including build instructions, consult the RtorrentExtended page!*
